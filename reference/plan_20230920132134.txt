Plan for creating a custom Docker image with Redis, RedisGears, and RedisAI:
1. Create a new Dockerfile that starts from the existing Redis image.
2. Add the necessary commands to install RedisGears and RedisAI in the Dockerfile.
3. Build the Docker image and test it locally to ensure everything works as expected.
4. Push the Docker image to the Azure Container Registry.
